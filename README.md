<h1>Strategic Evaluation of GRC Tools for a FinTech Company</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I led the evaluation of GRC tools to ensure alignment with GDPR, CCPA, and other global regulations. The focus was on regulatory compliance, data discovery, consent management, data subject rights (DSR) automation, privacy by design, scalability, and reporting.

<h2>Assessment</h2>

Given the organizationâ€™s responsibility for processing sensitive data across multiple jurisdictions, I assessed tools against their ability to support GDPR and CCPA requirements, automate privacy operations, and scale effectively.<br>
Based on this evaluation, I recommended six tools:<br> 
- OneTrust - Comprehensive GDPR/CCPA compliance, consent management<br>
- TrustArc - Scalable privacy management and regulatory reporting<br>
- Securiti.ai - AI-driven PrivacyOps and automated DSR workflows<br>
- BigID - Advanced data discovery and classification across enterprise systems<br> 
- Collibra - Strong data governance and enterprise-wide integration<br>
- PrivIQ - Lightweight compliance management for smaller-scale operations<br>

These solutions were positioned to close compliance gaps, automate privacy functions, and embed privacy by design. They provided the organization with the capability to scale securely, meet evolving global regulatory obligations, and maintain user trust.
