<h1>Strategic Evaluation of GRC Tools for Global Privacy Compliance</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I led the evaluation of GRC tools to ensure alignment with GDPR, CCPA, and global regulations. I recommended OneTrust, TrustArc, Securiti.ai, BigID, Collibra, and PrivIQ, selected for their strengths in regulatory support, data discovery, consent management, DSR automation, and privacy by design. These solutions will close compliance gaps, automate privacy operations, and position the organization to scale securely while maintaining user trust.

<h2>Assessment</h2>

Given  the organization's responsibility for processing sensitive data across jurisdictions, I focused the assessment on regulatory alignment (GDPR, CCPA), data discovery, consent management, DSR automation, privacy by design, scalability, and reporting.

Based on this evaluation, I recommended six tools:<br> 
- OneTrust<br>
- TrustArc<br>
- Securiti.ai<br>
- BigID<br> 
- Collibra<br>
- PrivIQ<br>
Each selected for addressing critical needs such as GDPR compliance, automated DSR workflows, AI-driven PrivacyOps, advanced data discovery, enterprise governance, and lightweight compliance management.

These recommendations will help the company close compliance gaps, automate privacy functions, and embed privacy by design, enabling the organization to scale securely, meet global regulatory obligations, and maintain user trust.
